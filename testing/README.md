Testing Requirements for all GPS Modules

## Test 0
### Purpose
- Make sure the soldering job is adequate
### Tasks
- Continuinity check to ensure all connections and chips are secure

## Test 1
### Purpose
- See how long it takes for Time to Live (TTL)
### Tasks
- Position the boards in the following environments:
  - Inside (specifically the PAST Lab)
  - Outside (specifically the oval)
  - Near a high noise device (specifically a phone)
- Time how long for each the the boards to acquire a signal

## Test 2
### Purpose
- Test the accuracy of the GPS modules
### Tasks
- Determine the exact lat/long of an outside location using an RTK GPS
- Let each GPS run for 2 minutes to obtain a baseline reading
- Compare this reading to the exact reading
